[[spring-cloud-consul-retry]]
= Consul Retry

If you expect that the consul agent may occasionally be unavailable when
your app starts, you can ask it to keep trying after a failure. You need to add
`spring-retry` and `spring-boot-starter-aop` to your classpath. The default
behaviour is to retry 6 times with an initial backoff interval of 1000ms and an
exponential multiplier of 1.1 for subsequent backoffs. You can configure these
properties (and others) using `spring.cloud.consul.retry.*` configuration properties.
This works with both Spring Cloud Consul Config and Discovery registration.

TIP: To take full control of the retry add a `@Bean` of type
`RetryOperationsInterceptor` with id "consulRetryInterceptor". Spring
Retry has a `RetryInterceptorBuilder` that makes it easy to create one.
