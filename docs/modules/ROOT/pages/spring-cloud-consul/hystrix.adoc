= Circuit Breaker with Hystrix

Applications can use the Hystrix Circuit Breaker provided by the Spring Cloud Netflix project by including this starter in the projects pom.xml: `spring-cloud-starter-hystrix`.  Hystrix doesn't depend on the Netflix Discovery Client. The `@EnableHystrix` annotation should be placed on a configuration class (usually the main class). Then methods can be annotated with `@HystrixCommand` to be protected by a circuit breaker. See https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud.html#_circuit_breaker_hystrix_clients[the documentation] for more details.
