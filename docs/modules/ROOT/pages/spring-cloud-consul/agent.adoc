= Consul Agent
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

A Consul Agent client must be available to all Spring Cloud Consul applications.  By default, the Agent client is expected to be at `localhost:8500`.  See the https://consul.io/docs/agent/basics.html[Agent documentation] for specifics on how to start an Agent client and how to connect to a cluster of Consul Agent Servers.  For development, after you have installed consul, you may start a Consul Agent using the following command:

----
./src/main/bash/local_run_consul.sh
----

This will start an agent in server mode on port 8500, with the ui available at http://localhost:8500
